# Mahjong‑Like (Vanilla JS)

A lightweight, Mahjong-solitaire–inspired pair‑matching game for the browser.

## Rules (simplified)
- Click two identical tiles to remove them.
- A tile is **free** if it has no neighbor on its **left** or **right** side.
- Clear all tiles to win. If no free matches remain, try **Shuffle**.

## Features
- Vanilla **HTML + CSS + JS** (no dependencies).
- New Game, Undo, Hint, Shuffle.
- Timer, move counter, remaining tiles display.
- Accessible buttons (keyboard focusable).

## Run
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. That's it.
